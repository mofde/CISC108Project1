The computer will think of a secret number from 1 to 10 and ask the user to guess it. After each guess, the computer will tell the user whether the number is too high or too low. The user wins if they can guess the number within whatever the computerâ€™s number is.
I decided to give only ten attempts to guess because it would be more interesting if there was a tie or draw. However, it would be a rare case for smart players. Ten tries would be a great number because the maximum is ten.
